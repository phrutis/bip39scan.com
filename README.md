All clients perform their part (chunk) of the overall task.<br>
Only CUDA cards support GTX, RTX, CMP<br>
Need RAM - 16 GB<br>
Brute speed:<br>
RTX 4090 = 60k/s<br>
RTX 5090 = 90k/s<br>

The client automatically downloads the address database. <br>
If the database on the server has changed, it automatically updates it. <br>
After downloading, the client checks the checksum of the database, which excludes incompletely downloaded addresses.
The client displays only the speed.<br>
If the client finds an address, the window displays the found address.<br>

For anonymity, use your BTC address instead of a nickname.<br>
Use your address, 70% will be paid to it

You can use a nickname in the pool.<br>
You need to write @phrutis your nickname and your BTC address.<br>
I will add your address to the private list.

How do I know what I found?<br>
The found address(es) will appear in your client window<br>
The bot will send a message to the telegram group https://t.me/bip39scan with information about the find.
