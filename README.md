## FAQ
**What does this pool do?**

Collectively brute forces passwords from old wallets created on bip32.org and others.<br>
A given alphabet is used for brute forcing, each client. <br>
Each card searches for its own piece of the main task.<hr>

**Will this pool work on my pc?**

Only CUDA cards support GTX, RTX, CMP<br>
Need RAM - 16 GB<br>
Brute speed:<br>
RTX 4090 = 60k/s<br>
RTX 5090 = 90k/s<hr>

**Why does the program require 16 GB of RAM?**

The client automatically downloads the address database 11 GB (binary format). <br>
The database is loaded into RAM and eats up 12 GB of memory, another 4 GB is needed for the system.<br>
If the database on the server has changed, it automatically updates it. <br>
After downloading, the client checks the checksum of the database, which excludes incompletely downloaded addresses.<hr>

**I want to search anonymously, how can I do this?**

For anonymity, use your BTC address instead of a nickname.<br>
Use your address, 70% will be paid to it<hr>

**How to search by nickname?**

You can use a nickname in the pool. Use xx -u Yournick --bloom 2048M<br>
You need to write @phrutis your nickname and your BTC address.<br>
I will add your address to the private list.<hr>

**How do I know what I found?**

The bot will send a message to the telegram group https://t.me/bip39scan with information about the find.<br>
If the client finds an address, the window displays the found address.<br>
